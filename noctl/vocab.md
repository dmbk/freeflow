###Vocab

**Command** - The operation performed by a program which is specified through the command-line. A single program may be capable of executing many different commands, but accepts only one command per program call.


**Flag** - A boolean value which can be set (true) or unset (false).


**Flag Option** - A command-line option to set the value of a flag. The value is inferred from the option and therefore need not be specified explicitly as e.g. 'set' or 'unset'. Thus, a flag may need up to two distinct options: one to set and one to unset the flag.
